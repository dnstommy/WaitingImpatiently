Examining search indexes is essential for Sitecore development and custom index field creation. I encountered a problem: my standard Luke tool couldn't access SOLR indexes on my projects.

After investigation, I discovered that **Luke 6.3 will open my SOLR indexes**. Download version 6.3.0 from the GitHub releases repository.

**Update:** For SOLR 6.2.2 users, Luke 7.2 is recommended.

## Alternative: Sitecore PowerShell Extensions

For those without server access, the index viewer feature in Sitecore PowerShell Extensions works well. This tool allows users to view available indexes and construct queries without direct server connection.

Installation involves:
1. Adding the main extension
2. Installing the "Authorable Reports for SPE 4.x" package

After installation, access the Index Viewer from the PowerShell Toolbox in Sitecore Desktop to search and analyze indexes.

Happy indexing.
