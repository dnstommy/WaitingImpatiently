Sitecore announced the availability of Azure Toolkit 1.1, introducing several enhancements. A particularly significant update addresses Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) requirements by adding compatibility with Web Forms for Marketers 8.2 update 3.

Previously, running WFFM on Azure required Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) configuration. This compatibility upgrade means organizations can now leverage PaaS deployments provided their Sitecore installation meets version 8.2 U3 specifications.

A remaining gap exists: support for Email Experience Manager (EXM) functionality within PaaS environments remains unavailable. Hopefully forthcoming updates will enable comprehensive marketing capabilities on Azure PaaS.
