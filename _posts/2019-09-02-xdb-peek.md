Bonfire has unveiled xDB Peek, an evolved version of their analytics data transfer object project. This tool provides an accessible, styled interface for viewing comprehensive information about Sitecore website visitors.

## Key Features

The tool displays:
- xConnect Details
- Facets
- Goals
- Marketing Plans
- Campaigns
- History
- Patterns and profiles

## Background

The project originated in 2017 when James Williamson requested a way to identify a user's profile during an active session without terminating it. The initial solution used a simple API endpoint (`/apis/v1/visitordetails`) that returned xConnect profile data in JSON format.

## Evolution to xDB Peek

The upgrade transforms this functionality into a user-friendly interface accessible without browser extensions. Instead of viewing raw JSON strings, data now organizes into distinct tabs for clarity. The tool supports both desktop and mobile viewing, recognizing that personalization experiences differ across devices.

## Future Development

The team plans to expand beyond read-only capabilities, adding functions such as triggering goals, enrolling users in pattern cards, merging contacts, and executing other operational tasks.

The release targets Sitecore 9.x versions and is available on GitHub at the Bonfire repository.
